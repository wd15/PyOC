# Test Data Files

This directory contains test data for the pyopencalphad repository.

## `co_chimad.tdb`

Co alloy database from CHiMaD. It was collected by Peishing Wong
in 2016. The format is given in
http://www.thermocalc.com/media/22867/thermo-calc-database-manager-guide.pdf.

## `fe_ni_fcc_thermocalc.dat`

Fe/Ni alloy free energy curve for FCC. The first column is temperature
and the second column is Gibbs free energy. It is calculated using
thermocalc with 1 mole of material at 100000 Pa and a composition
of 0.1 Ni.

## `fe_ni_bcc_thermocalc.dat`

Fe/Ni alloy free energy curve for BCC. The first column is temperature
and the second column is Gibbs free energy. It is calculated using
thermocalc with 1 mole of material at 100000 Pa and a composition
of 0.1 Ni.

## `fe_ni_liq_thermocalc.dat`

Fe/Ni alloy free energy curve for a liquid. The first column is
temperature and the second column is Gibbs free energy. It is
calculated using thermocalc with 1 mole of material at 100000 Pa and a
composition of 0.1 Ni.
